A Pokédex displaying basic information on existing Pokémon.

All of the data used in this app was taken from the Pokemon API.

Many of the newer Pokémon are missing information as the API is still being updated, so some Pokémon may be missing information. 

Also, many of the Pokémon have certain forms that influence the API's naming of the Pokémon (i.e. Enamorus is named 'enamorus-incarnate'). Therefore, only the first name of the Pokémon or their Pokédex ID were used as identifiers.

This app was created using Next.js and styled using TailwindCSS. 

It was my first time working with TailwindCSS and server-side rendering and my attempt at integrating them together with my basic understandings of Next.js.

I hope you enjoy it!
