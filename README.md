A Pokédex displaying basic information on existing Pokémon.

All of the data used in this app was taken from the Pokemon API.

Only 905 Pokemon of the entire Pokemon roster as many of the newer Pokemon are missing information as the API is still being updated. Also, many of the pokemon ahve certain forms that influence the API's naming of the pokemon (i.e. Enamorus is named 'enamorus-incarnate'). Therefore, only the first name of the Pokemon were used.

This app was created using Next.js and styled using TailwindCSS. 

It was my first time working with TailwindCSS and server-side rendering and my attempt at integrating them together with my basic understandings of Next.js.

I hope you enjoy it!
